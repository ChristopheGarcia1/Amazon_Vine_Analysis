## Summary

From the results provided by this analysis, in the scope of video game reviews, there is not much proof of bais amongst those enrolled in the vine program. As a matter of fact, Vine members seem to rate things harsher than those not in the program. Since this is only looking at one data set, further analysis should be done to see if bias exist among other products.
